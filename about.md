## Blog metadata

This blog is based on the [Hyde]({{ site.hyde_repo }}) theme (v{{ site.hyde_version }}) for [Poole](http://getpoole.com), which is sadly unsupported at the time of writing (2021), running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) but with some modifications, mostly by [frederikaverpil](fredrikaverpil/fredrikaverpil.github.io). 
What follows is a non-exhaustive list of alterations to the design:

- General theming changes
- Font changed to subjectively improve the design
- Removed comment functionality
- Removed Google Analytics, a personal pet peeve
- Switched from a dark syntax theme to [pygments'](https://pygments.org/) default setting for a more welcoming feel
- dealt with irregularities occuring when filtering by tags


The source code for this blog is available [here]({{ site.github.repo }}).
