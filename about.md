title: About
---

Throughout the years I've been spending my professional life within the digital domain of creativity and programming; from web site design/development to 3D animation and digital visual effects for feature films. I've had professional experience within the field of 3D graphics since 2005, including co-founding [Filmgate](http://www.filmgate.se) and developing the computer graphics pipeline at [Industriromantik](http://www.industriromantik.se). Today, I take part in an extraordinary team of talent at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com) in the role of Design Architect. Here, besides development predominantly in Python, I get to work with cloud native technologies such as OpenStack, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm and Spinnaker.

## Blog metadata

This blog is based on the [Hyde]({{ site.hyde_repo }}) theme (v{{ site.hyde_version }}) for [Poole](http://getpoole.com), which is sadly unsupported at the time of writing (2021), running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) but with some modifications, mostly by [frederikaverpil](fredrikaverpil/fredrikaverpil.github.io). 
What follows is a non-exhaustive list of alterations to the design:

- General theming changes
- Font changed to subjectively improve the design
- Removed comment functionality
- Removed Google Analytics, a personal pet peeve
- Switched from a dark syntax theme to [pygments'](https://pygments.org/) default setting for a more welcoming feel
- dealt with irregularities occuring when filtering by tags
